/**
 * Chart.js v4.4.0
 * This is a proxied version of the Chart.js library for local use
 * Original source: https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/chart.js@4.4.0/dist/chart.umd.js
 * 
 * This file is intentionally left as a reference only.
 * The actual Chart.js library is loaded from the CDN as specified in __manifest__.py:
 * 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/chart.js@4.4.0/dist/chart.umd.js'
 *
 * Note: To ensure proper loading of Chart.js in Odoo, make sure the library is
 * correctly referenced in the assets section of __manifest__.py
 * 
 * IMPORTANT: This module now uses a fallback mechanism implemented in chart.fallback.js
 * which will automatically try alternative CDNs if the primary one fails.
 * The following CDNs are used as fallbacks:
 * 1. https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/Chart.js/4.4.0/chart.umd.js
 * 2. https://unpkg.com/chart.js@4.4.0/dist/chart.umd.js

// This file is not used directly - Chart.js is loaded from CDN with fallbacks
// If you need to include Chart.js locally instead of from CDN:
// 1. Download Chart.js v4.4.0 from https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/chart.js@4.4.0/dist/chart.umd.js
// 2. Replace this file content with the downloaded file
// 3. Update __manifest__.py to reference this local file instead of the CDN
// 4. Update chart.fallback.js to disable the fallback mechanism
