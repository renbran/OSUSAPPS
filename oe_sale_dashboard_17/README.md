## Changes Made

### Backend Changes
1. **New Model Fields**:
   - `booking_date`: Datetime field in sale.order model
   - `sale_value`: Monetary field in sale.order model

2. **Data Migration**:
   - Automatic initialization of booking_date for existing records
   - Default booking_date set to current date/time for new records

### Frontend Changes
1. **Date Range Selector**: Replaced single date picker with start/end date inputs
2. **Amount Field Dropdown**: Added dropdown to choose between Total Amount and Sale Value
3. **Simplified Table Layout**: Removed time period columns, showing only Company and Amount
4. **Real-time Updates**: Dashboard updates automatically when filters change

2. **Modern Styling**: Clean, professional appearance with proper spacing
3. **Loading Indicators**: Clear feedback during data loading
4. **User-friendly Labels**: Clear field names and descriptions

## Installation Notes

1. **Module Dependencies**: Requires `sale_management` module
2. **Field Migration**: The module will automatically migrate existing data on installation
3. **Database Changes**: New fields will be added to the sale_order table

## Usage

1. **Access**: Navigate to Sales â†’ Sales Report from the main menu
