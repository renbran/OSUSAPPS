# Deprecation Notice for OE Sale Dashboard 17

## Problematic Files

The following files were identified as problematic and have been replaced with simplified fallback versions:

1. `static/src/js/dashboard_merged.js`
   - Missing essential functions: `renderChart`, `updateDashboard`, and `fetchData`
   - Incorrect component registration: using wrong tag name

2. `static/src/xml/dashboard_merged_template.xml`
   - While correctly defined, this template relied on functions missing in the JS file

## Simplified Replacement

The problematic files have been replaced with:

1. `static/src/js/dashboard_fixed.js`
   - Contains simplified, but functional implementations of all required methods
   - Uses static data as a fallback
   - Has proper component registration

2. `static/src/xml/dashboard_fixed_template.xml`
   - Simplified template that works with the fixed JS component
   - Provides basic dashboard functionality

## Manifest Updates

The `__manifest__.py` file has been updated to:

1. Remove external CDN dependencies
2. Reference the new fixed files instead of the problematic ones

## Next Steps

The simplified fallback dashboard provides basic functionality. For full functionality, a complete rewrite of the dashboard component is recommended, following Odoo 17's best practices for OWL components.

Key improvements for future versions:
- Implement proper server data fetching
- Add more interactive features
- Enhance chart visualizations
- Implement dynamic filtering
