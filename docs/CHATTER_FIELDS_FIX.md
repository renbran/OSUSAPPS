# Commission App Chatter Fields Fix

## Issue
**RPC Error**: `Field "message_follower_ids" does not exist in model "commission.rule"`

## Root Cause
The commission_app views included chatter sections (`message_follower_ids`, `activity_ids`, `message_ids`) for models that don't inherit from `mail.thread`.

## Models Analysis
| Model | Inherits mail.thread? | Chatter Support | Action Taken |
|-------|---------------------|----------------|--------------|
| `commission.rule` | ❌ No | ❌ No | ✅ Removed chatter |
| `commission.period` | ❌ No | ❌ No | ✅ Removed chatter |
| `commission.allocation` | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ✅ Kept chatter |

## Files Modified
1. `commission_app/views/commission_rule_views.xml`
   - Removed `<div class="oe_chatter">` section
   - Removed `message_follower_ids`, `activity_ids`, `message_ids` fields

2. `commission_app/views/commission_period_views.xml` 
   - Removed `<div class="oe_chatter">` section
   - Removed `message_follower_ids`, `activity_ids`, `message_ids` fields

3. `commission_app/views/commission_allocation_views.xml`
   - **No changes** - correctly keeps chatter (model inherits mail.thread)

## Verification
Run verification script: `./scripts/verify_chatter_fix.sh`

## Deployment Notes
- Changes committed to git: commit `fb78f184d`
- Changes pushed to remote repository
- **Server restart required** after deployment to clear Odoo registry cache
- **Module update required** if module is already installed

## Technical Details
In Odoo 17, only models that inherit from `mail.thread` can use chatter functionality. Models without this inheritance cannot have:
- `message_follower_ids` (followers)
- `activity_ids` (activities) 
- `message_ids` (messages/chatter history)

Including these fields in views for non-mail models causes RPC errors during module installation.
