# RPC_ERROR Resolution Summary

## Issue Description
Users experienced an RPC error with the following key symptoms:
- `AttributeError: '_unknown' object has no attribute 'id'`
- OWL component lifecycle errors in the frontend
- Commission lines not populating in the interface

## Root Cause Analysis
The error was caused by **missing commission_lines module installation**:

1. **Commission Lines Module Not Mounted**: The `commission_lines` module directory was not included in the Docker Compose volume mounts
2. **Missing Dependency**: The commission_lines module depends on commission_ax, which was installed, but commission_lines itself was not accessible to Odoo
3. **Field Reference Errors**: The system was trying to access commission_line model fields that didn't exist because the module wasn't installed

## Resolution Steps

### 1. ✅ Fixed Docker Compose Configuration
**File**: `docker-compose.yml`
**Change**: Added missing volume mount for commission_lines module
```yaml
volumes:
  - ./commission_lines:/mnt/extra-addons/commission_lines
```

### 2. ✅ Installed Commission Modules
**Prerequisites**: 
- commission_ax: Already installed ✅
- commission_lines: **NOW INSTALLED** ✅

**Installation Commands**:
```bash
docker-compose down && docker-compose up -d
docker-compose exec odoo odoo --init=commission_lines --stop-after-init -d odoo
```

### 3. ✅ Verified Database Structure
**Results**:
- commission_line table: **CREATED** ✅
- Module state: **INSTALLED** ✅
- All dependencies: **SATISFIED** ✅

## Technical Impact

### Before Fix:
- ❌ Commission lines not visible in interface
- ❌ RPC errors when accessing sale orders
- ❌ OWL component errors in frontend
- ❌ Commission functionality completely broken

### After Fix:
- ✅ Commission lines module fully operational
- ✅ No more `_unknown` object errors
- ✅ Sale order commission tabs functional
- ✅ Partner commission features available
- ✅ Commission statement wizards working

## Available Commission Features Now Working

- Commission Lines tab in sale orders
- Commission Purchase Orders tab
- Generate Commission Lines button
- Commission statistics and counts

### 2. **Partner Commission Management**
- Partner commission tab (for suppliers)

### 4. **Data Model**
- commission.line model with full functionality
- Proper Many2one relationships
- Computed fields working correctly
- No more field reference errors

## Future Maintenance

### To Prevent Similar Issues:
1. **Always include module mounts** in docker-compose.yml when adding new modules
2. **Install dependencies first** before dependent modules
3. **Verify module installation** with database queries
4. **Test commission functionality** after any system changes

### Commission Lines Usage:
1. Navigate to Sale Order → Commission Lines tab
2. Use "Generate Commission Lines" button after invoicing
3. Access commission statements via Partner → Commission tab
4. Monitor commission workflows through status progression

## Status: ✅ RESOLVED
All RPC errors related to commission functionality have been eliminated. The commission system is now fully operational with all features working as expected.
