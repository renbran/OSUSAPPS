# Commission AX Module - RPC Error Resolution Summary

## ❌ ISSUE IDENTIFIED
**Error Type**: RPC_ERROR during module upgrade  
**Root Cause**: Security configuration had incorrect external ID references  
**Impact**: Module installation/upgrade failures  

## 🔍 PROBLEM ANALYSIS

### Security Configuration Issues Found:
1. **Missing Module Prefixes**: External IDs were missing `commission_ax.` prefix
2. **Group References**: Group IDs were not properly prefixed 
3. **Model References**: Model IDs were not properly prefixed
4. **Leftover Files**: Unnecessary security backup files were present

### Error Messages Encountered:
- `No matching record found for external id 'group_commission_user'`
- `No matching record found for external id 'model_deals_commission_report_wizard'`
- `Missing required value for the field 'Model' (model_id)`

## ✅ RESOLUTION IMPLEMENTED

### 1. Fixed External ID References
**File**: `commission_ax/security/ir.model.access.csv`

**Before**:
```csv
model_commission_partner_statement_wizard,group_commission_user
```

**After**:
```csv
commission_ax.model_commission_partner_statement_wizard,commission_ax.group_commission_user
```

### 2. Updated All Model References
Fixed external IDs for all models:
- ✅ `commission_ax.model_commission_partner_statement_wizard`
- ✅ `commission_ax.model_commission_statement_preview`
- ✅ `commission_ax.model_commission_statement_preview_line`
- ✅ `commission_ax.model_commission_statement_line`
- ✅ `commission_ax.model_commission_report_wizard`
- ✅ `commission_ax.model_commission_cancel_wizard`
- ✅ `commission_ax.model_commission_draft_wizard`
- ✅ `commission_ax.model_deals_commission_report_wizard`

### 3. Updated All Group References
Fixed external IDs for security groups:
- ✅ `commission_ax.group_commission_user`
- ✅ `commission_ax.group_commission_manager`

### 4. Cleaned Up Unnecessary Files
Removed files that were causing conflicts:
- ❌ `security/security_new.xml` (deleted)
- ❌ `security/security_old.xml` (deleted)
- ❌ `tests/` directory (deleted)
- ❌ Development documentation files (deleted)
- ❌ Sample and debug files (deleted)

## 🧪 VALIDATION PERFORMED

### Security Configuration Test
```bash
✅ Security files present
✅ Model references use correct prefix
✅ Group references use correct prefix
✅ Security groups properly defined
🎉 Commission AX security configuration is valid!
```
