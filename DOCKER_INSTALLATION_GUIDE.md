   # Or using legacy docker-compose  
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

### Step 2: Verify Environment

1. **Check container status**
   ```bash
   docker compose ps
   ```

2. **Monitor Odoo logs**
   ```bash
   docker compose logs -f web
   ```

3. **Access Odoo**
   - Open browser to: http://localhost:8069

#### Method B: Via Command Line
```bash
# Install commission_app module directly
docker compose exec web odoo --stop-after-init --init=commission_app --db_host=db --db_user=odoo --db_password=myodoo -d your_database_name

# Or update if already installed
docker compose exec web odoo --stop-after-init --update=commission_app --db_host=db --db_user=odoo --db_password=myodoo -d your_database_name
```

   - Shows each sale order with commission breakdown by category
   - Individual totals for Legacy, External, Internal, Management, etc.

2. **Category Summary Report**:
   - Aggregate analysis by commission category
   - Total amounts and allocation counts per category
   - Trend analysis over time

### Production Features
- **Automated commission creation** from sale orders
- **Multi-level approval workflow** for payments
- **Batch processing** for large datasets
- **Excel export** with professional formatting
- **Real-time calculations** with proper caching
- **Comprehensive audit trail** via Odoo's built-in system

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Module Installation Fails**
   ```bash
   # Check Odoo logs
   docker compose logs web | grep -i error
   
   # Restart containers
   docker compose restart
   ```

2. **Permission Denied**
   ```bash
   # Ensure proper file permissions
   sudo chown -R 101:101 ./commission_app
   ```

3. **Database Connection Issues**
   ```bash
   # Check database container
   docker compose logs db
   
   # Restart database
   docker compose restart db
   ```

### Validation Commands
```bash
# Re-run validation
./validate_commission_app.sh

# Check Docker status
docker compose ps

# Monitor real-time logs
docker compose logs -f web
```

## üìà Performance Monitoring

Monitor commission processing performance:
```bash
# Database queries
docker compose exec db psql -U odoo -d your_database -c "
SELECT schemaname,tablename,attname,n_distinct,correlation 
FROM pg_stats 
WHERE tablename LIKE '%commission%';"

# Memory usage
docker stats
```
