## 💼 Commission Calculation Logic

### **Field Mapping:**
- `broker_amount` = Amount * (broker_rate/100) or fixed amount
- `referrer_amount` = Amount * (referrer_rate/100) or fixed amount  
- `cashback_amount` = Amount * (cashback_rate/100) or fixed amount
- `agent1_amount` = Amount * (agent1_rate/100) or fixed amount
- `agent2_amount` = Amount * (agent2_rate/100) or fixed amount
- `manager_amount` = Amount * (manager_rate/100) or fixed amount
- `director_amount` = Amount * (director_rate/100) or fixed amount

### **Totals:**
- `total_external_commission_amount` = broker + referrer + cashback
- `total_internal_commission_amount` = agent1 + agent2 + manager + director
- `total_commission_amount` = external + internal

    A[Draft] --> B[Documents Under Review]
    B --> C[Commission Calculate]
    C --> D[Posted]
    D --> E[Done]
    B --> A
    C --> B
    D --> C
```

### **Business Logic:**
1. **Draft → Documents Under Review:** Requires documentation_user_id
2. **Documents → Commission Calculate:** Requires commission_user_id  
3. **Commission → Posted:** Requires final_review_user_id
4. **Posted → Done:** Management approval completes workflow
5. **Rejection:** Returns to previous stage with notification
