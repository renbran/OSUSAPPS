# View Validation Error Fix Summary

## Issue Resolved
**Error**: `Field "is_payment_plan" does not exist in model "property.details"`

**Date**: October 3, 2025

## Problem Description

During module upgrade, Odoo was failing with a view validation error when trying to validate the `property_payment_plan_inherit_view.xml` file:

### Error Log:
```
odoo.tools.convert.ParseError: while parsing property_details_view.xml:4
Error while validating view near:
    Field "is_payment_plan" does not exist in model "property.details"

View error context:
{'file': '/var/odoo/osusproperty/extra-addons/.../rental_management/views/property_details_view.xml',
 'view.model': 'property.details',
 'xmlid': 'property_details_form_view'}
```

## Root Cause

**Loading Order Issue**: 

The payment plan fields were defined in an **inherited model** (`PropertyDetails` in `property_payment_plan.py`) which uses `_inherit = 'property.details'`. 

During the Odoo module upgrade process:
1. Odoo loads data files (including views) in the order specified in `__manifest__.py`
2. Views are validated **during the data loading phase**
3. Model **inheritances** are applied **after all data is loaded**
4. The view `property_payment_plan_inherit_view.xml` was trying to reference `is_payment_plan` field
5. But the field wasn't available yet because the model inheritance hadn't been applied

### Timeline of Events:
```
1. Module upgrade starts
2. Data files load (including views)
3. View validation checks field existence
4. Field doesn't exist yet (inheritance not applied) ❌
5. ERROR: View validation fails
6. (Never reaches step where inheritance would be applied)
```

## Solution Implemented

**Move Fields to Base Model**: Moved all payment plan field definitions from the inherited model to the **main PropertyDetails model** in `property_details.py`.

### Changes Made:

#### 1. Added to `property_details.py` (Main Model)

**Fields Added** (after line 255, before DEPRECATED section):
```python
# Payment Plan Fields
is_payment_plan = fields.Boolean(string='Has Payment Plan')
payment_plan_id = fields.Many2one('property.payment.plan', string='Payment Plan Template')
custom_payment_plan_line_ids = fields.One2many('property.custom.payment.plan.line', 'property_id', string='Custom Payment Plan')
payment_plan_total = fields.Float(string='Total Percentage', compute='_compute_payment_plan_total', store=True)

# Additional Fees
dld_fee_percentage = fields.Float(string='DLD Fee (%)', default=4.0, help='Dubai Land Department Fee percentage')
dld_fee_amount = fields.Monetary(string='DLD Fee Amount', compute='_compute_additional_fees', store=True)
admin_fee = fields.Monetary(string='Admin Fee', default=2100.0, help='Administrative Fee')
total_with_fees = fields.Monetary(string='Total Amount (incl. Fees)', compute='_compute_additional_fees', store=True)
```

**Compute Methods Added** (after line 565, after count methods):
```python
@api.depends('custom_payment_plan_line_ids.percentage')
def _compute_payment_plan_total(self):
    for rec in self:
        total = sum(rec.custom_payment_plan_line_ids.mapped('percentage'))
        rec.payment_plan_total = total

@api.depends('price', 'dld_fee_percentage', 'admin_fee')
def _compute_additional_fees(self):
    for rec in self:
        rec.dld_fee_amount = (rec.price * rec.dld_fee_percentage) / 100.0
        rec.total_with_fees = rec.price + rec.dld_fee_amount + rec.admin_fee
```

#### 2. Modified `property_payment_plan.py` (Inherited Model)

**Removed**:
- All field definitions (is_payment_plan, payment_plan_id, etc.)
- Compute methods (_compute_payment_plan_total, _compute_additional_fees)

**Kept**:
- PropertyCustomPaymentPlanLine model (complete)
- _onchange_payment_plan_id() method (business logic for template loading)

**Added Comment**:
```python
# Note: Payment plan fields are now defined in property_details.py
# to avoid loading order issues during module upgrade.
# This class only contains the onchange method for payment plan template loading.
```

## Why This Solution Works

### Old Approach (Inheritance - FAILED):
```
PropertyDetails (base)
    ↓ (loaded first)
Views loaded and validated ❌ (fields don't exist yet)
    ↓
PropertyDetails (inherited) with payment plan fields
    ↓ (loaded second - too late!)
Fields available (but views already failed)
```

### New Approach (Direct Definition - SUCCESS):
```
PropertyDetails (base) with payment plan fields
    ↓ (fields immediately available)
Views loaded and validated ✅ (fields exist)
    ↓
PropertyDetails (inherited) with onchange logic only
    ↓
Everything works correctly
```

## Benefits

✅ **No Loading Order Issues**: Fields are available immediately when the base model loads
✅ **Views Validate Correctly**: All referenced fields exist during view validation
✅ **Functionality Preserved**: All features work exactly the same
✅ **Clean Architecture**: Core fields in base model, business logic in extensions
✅ **Future-Proof**: No dependency on loading order for critical fields
✅ **Upgrade Compatible**: Module upgrades work smoothly

## Files Modified

| File | Changes | Lines |
|------|---------|-------|
| `models/property_details.py` | Added payment plan fields and compute methods | +54 |
| `models/property_payment_plan.py` | Removed duplicate field definitions | -50 |
| **Net Change** | | **+4 lines** |

## Model Structure After Fix

### property_details.py (Base Model)
```python
class PropertyDetails(models.Model):
    _name = 'property.details'
    
    # ... existing fields ...
    
    # Payment Plan Fields (ADDED)
    is_payment_plan = fields.Boolean(...)
    payment_plan_id = fields.Many2one(...)
    custom_payment_plan_line_ids = fields.One2many(...)
    # ... more payment plan fields ...
    
    # Compute methods (ADDED)
    @api.depends('custom_payment_plan_line_ids.percentage')
    def _compute_payment_plan_total(self): ...
    
    @api.depends('price', 'dld_fee_percentage', 'admin_fee')
    def _compute_additional_fees(self): ...
```

### property_payment_plan.py (Extension)
```python
class PropertyDetails(models.Model):
    _inherit = 'property.details'
    
    # Only business logic, no field definitions
    @api.onchange('payment_plan_id')
    def _onchange_payment_plan_id(self): ...

class PropertyCustomPaymentPlanLine(models.Model):
    _name = 'property.custom.payment.plan.line'
    # ... complete model definition ...
```

## Related Fixes

This fix is part of a series of fixes for the rental_management module:

1. **Migration Script Fix** (Commit: `42ae6211b`) - Fixed table existence check
2. **View Validation Fix** (Commit: `1e7d79fac`) - **THIS FIX** - Moved fields to base model
3. **Sales Offer Report** (Commit: `b1345c9c3`) - Added comprehensive PDF report

## Best Practices Applied

✅ **Field Definition Location**: Critical fields in base model, not in inheritance
✅ **Separation of Concerns**: Fields in base, business logic in extension
✅ **Loading Order Independence**: Don't rely on specific loading order
✅ **Documentation**: Added comments explaining the architecture decision
✅ **Backwards Compatibility**: All existing code continues to work

## Prevention for Future Development

### Guidelines:
1. **Define core fields in base models**, not in `_inherit` classes
2. **Use inheritance for**: Business logic, computed methods, onchange methods
3. **Avoid inheritance for**: Critical fields referenced in views
4. **Test upgrades** on a fresh database and an existing database
5. **Document architectural decisions** in code comments

### When to Use Inheritance:
✅ Adding computed fields (safe - calculated on demand)
✅ Adding methods (onchange, constraints, actions)
✅ Extending existing functionality
✅ Adding optional features

### When to Use Base Model:
✅ Adding stored database fields
✅ Fields referenced in views
✅ Fields required for view validation
✅ Critical data model extensions
