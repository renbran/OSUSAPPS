## Technical Implementation Details

### Real-time Updates Implementation
```python
@api.onchange('approval_state')
def _onchange_approval_state_move(self):
    """Enhanced real-time status updates for invoice/bill approval workflow"""
    # Automatic timestamp and user assignment
    now = fields.Datetime.now()
    current_user = self.env.user
    
    if self.approval_state == 'under_review' and not self.reviewer_id:
        self.reviewer_id = current_user.id
        self.reviewer_date = now
```

### QR Code Generation
```python
def generate_qr_code_invoice(self):
    """Generate QR code for invoice/bill verification"""
    qr_data = {
        'type': 'invoice_verification',
        'number': self.name or '',
        'amount': str(self.amount_total),
        'approval_state': self.approval_state,
        'verification_url': f'{base_url}/web#id={self.id}&model=account.move'
    }
```

### Enhanced Validation System
```python
@api.onchange('amount_total', 'partner_id', 'invoice_date', 'invoice_line_ids')
def _onchange_invoice_validation_enhanced(self):
    """Multi-tier validation with comprehensive feedback"""
    if self.amount_total > 100000:  # Critical threshold
        warnings.append('CRITICAL: Amount exceeds $100,000')
    elif self.amount_total > 50000:  # High threshold
        warnings.append('HIGH: Amount exceeds $50,000')
```
