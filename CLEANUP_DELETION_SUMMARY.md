# Workspace Cleanup Deletion Summary

## Date: September 16, 2025

### Files Removed

The following files were identified as unnecessary (test files, sample files, not referenced in production manifests) and have been deleted:

- osus_invoice_report/test_tree_view.py
- report_xlsx/tests/test_report.py
- order_net_commission/tests/test_workflow.py
- payment_account_enhanced/test_qr_system.py
- tk_sale_split_invoice/tests/test_sale_split_invoice.py
- tk_partner_ledger/tests/test_partner_ledger.py
- payment_account_enhanced/tests/test_qr_verification.py
- test_payment_email_system.py
- test_email_automation.sh
- test_email_automation.py
- smile_access_control/tests/test_access_control.py
- smile_access_control/tests/test_users.py
- smile_access_control/tests/test_groups.py
- sale_order_invoicing_qty_percentage/tests/test_sale_order_invoicing_qty_percentage.py
- rental_management/tests/test_project.py
- osus_enterprise_module/wizard/sample_wizard.py
- osus_enterprise_module/report/sample_report.xml
- commission_ax/sample_report.html
- commission_ax/data/sample_commission_data.xml

### Rationale

- These files were not referenced in any manifest or production __init__.py files.
- They were identified as test, sample, or legacy files not required for production.
- Removal helps reduce clutter, improve maintainability, and prevent accidental execution of test code in production environments.

### Next Steps

- If any additional unnecessary files are found, repeat this process.
- Review __init__.py files in affected modules to remove any now-broken imports.
- Validate module functionality after cleanup.
