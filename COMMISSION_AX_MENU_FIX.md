# Commission AX Menu Fix: Missing Parent Menu

## Issue Summary

When trying to install/upgrade the `commission_ax` module, the following RPC error was encountered:

```text
ValueError: External ID not found in the system: commission_ax.menu_commission_reports
```

The error occurred because the `deals_commission_report_wizard_views.xml` file included a menuitem that referenced a parent menu that didn't exist in the system.

## Root Cause Analysis

In the file `commission_ax/views/deals_commission_report_wizard_views.xml`, there was a menuitem defined:

```xml
<menuitem id="menu_deals_commission_report"
          name="Comprehensive Deals Report"
          parent="menu_commission_reports"
          action="action_deals_commission_report_wizard"
          sequence="15"
          groups="base.group_user"/>
```

The parent menu `menu_commission_reports` was referenced but never defined in any of the module's XML files. This caused the installation/upgrade to fail because Odoo couldn't resolve the parent menu ID.

## Solution Implemented

1. Created a new file `commission_ax/views/commission_menu.xml` with the necessary parent menu definitions:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<odoo>
    <data>
        <!-- Define the parent menu for Commission Reports -->
        <menuitem id="menu_commission_root"
                  name="Commissions"
                  parent="sale.sale_menu_root"
                  sequence="18"/>
                  
        <menuitem id="menu_commission_reports"
                  name="Commission Reports"
                  parent="menu_commission_root"
                  sequence="10"/>
    </data>
</odoo>
```

1. Added the new file to the module's manifest in the `data` section:

```python
'data': [
    # other entries...
    'views/commission_menu.xml',
    # other entries...
],
```

## Menu Structure

The updated menu structure is now:

```
Sales (sale.sale_menu_root)
└── Commissions (menu_commission_root)
    └── Commission Reports (menu_commission_reports)
        └── Comprehensive Deals Report (menu_deals_commission_report)
```

This structure ensures proper organization of the commission-related menu items and places them within the Sales application where they're most relevant.

## Verification Steps

To verify the fix:

1. Update the module:

```bash
docker-compose exec odoo odoo --update=commission_ax --stop-after-init -d your_database
```

1. Restart the Odoo server:

```bash
docker-compose restart odoo
```

1. Confirm that the menu structure appears correctly under Sales → Commissions → Commission Reports

1. Verify that clicking the "Comprehensive Deals Report" menu item opens the report wizard correctly

This fix ensures proper menu navigation and resolves the RPC error during module installation or update.
