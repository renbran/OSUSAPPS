## Cost Comparison

| Provider | Cost | Free Tier | Local |
|----------|------|-----------|-------|
| Ollama | Free | ‚úÖ Unlimited | ‚úÖ Yes |
| Google Gemini | Free tier + pay-per-use | ‚úÖ Generous limits | ‚ùå No |
| OpenAI | Pay-per-use | ‚ùå No | ‚ùå No |
| Anthropic | Pay-per-use | ‚ùå No | ‚ùå No |

## Privacy & Security

- **Local Models (Ollama)**: Complete privacy, no data leaves your server
- **Cloud APIs**: Data sent to respective AI providers (check their privacy policies)
- **No Third-party Tracking**: This module doesn't send any data to external analytics services

## Customization

### Creating Custom Agents

1. Define clear system prompts that specify:
   - The agent's role and expertise
   - What data they should analyze
   - Expected output format
   - Specific instructions

2. Example system prompt for a custom inventory agent:
   ```
   You are an Inventory Optimization Specialist for an Odoo ERP system. 
   Analyze current stock levels, sales trends, and supplier performance.
   Provide specific recommendations for:
   - Products to reorder immediately
   - Overstock situations to address
   - Supplier performance issues
   Always include specific product names and quantities in your recommendations.
   ```

### Advanced Configuration

- **Model Access**: Grant agents access to specific Odoo models
- **Context Data**: Provide additional context or constraints
- **Token Limits**: Control AI response length and costs
- **Temperature**: Adjust creativity vs. consistency (0.0 = deterministic, 1.0 = creative)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Connection failed"**:
   - Check API key is correct
   - Verify internet connection
   - For Ollama: ensure service is running (`ollama serve`)

2. **"No AI provider configured"**:
   - Set up at least one AI provider
   - Mark it as active
   - Set as default in settings

3. **"Agent execution failed"**:
   - Check agent has access to required models
   - Verify system prompt is clear and specific
   - Check token limits aren't too restrictive

4. **High costs with paid APIs**:
   - Reduce max_tokens setting
   - Use less expensive models (GPT-3.5 vs GPT-4)
   - Consider switching to Ollama for cost savings

### Support

- Create issues on GitHub for bugs or feature requests
- Check Odoo logs for detailed error messages
- Test AI provider connections individually
