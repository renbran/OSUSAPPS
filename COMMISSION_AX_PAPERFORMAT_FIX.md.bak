# Commission Module Fix: Paperformat Reference

## Issue Summary

The commission_ax module was failing to initialize on staging-erposus.com due to a missing external ID reference:

```plain
ValueError: External ID not found in the system: base.paperformat_a4
```

This error occurred in the `deals_commission_report.xml` file where the report action was referencing a paper format that wasn't available in the database.

## Fix Applied
1. **Created a new paperformat data file**: 
   - Added `data/paperformat_data.xml` to define the A4 paper format within the module
   - This ensures the paper format exists before it's referenced

2. **Updated the report action reference**:
   - Changed the paperformat reference from `base.paperformat_a4` to `commission_ax.paperformat_a4`
   - This points to our newly defined paper format

3. **Updated the module manifest**:
   - Added the new data file to the manifest's data list
   - Ensures the paper format is loaded when the module is installed/updated

## Files Changed
1. `commission_ax/data/paperformat_data.xml` (new file)
2. `commission_ax/reports/deals_commission_report.xml`
3. `commission_ax/__manifest__.py`

## Deployment Instructions

### On Development Environment
1. Restart Odoo and update the module:
   ```bash
   docker-compose restart odoo
   docker-compose exec odoo odoo --update=commission_ax --stop-after-init -d your_database
   ```

### On Production/Staging
1. Apply the same changes to the production codebase:
   - Add the new paperformat_data.xml file
   - Update the deals_commission_report.xml reference
   - Update the manifest
   
2. Update the module on the server:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/odoo
   ./odoo-bin --update=commission_ax --stop-after-init -d your_database
   ```
   
3. Restart the Odoo service:
   ```bash
   service odoo restart
   # OR
   systemctl restart odoo
   ```

## Verification
After applying the changes, verify that:
1. The module updates without errors
2. The commission reports can be generated successfully
3. The PDF output uses the correct A4 paper format

## Notes
This issue occurred because Odoo 17 might have changed how some base paper formats are defined or referenced. By explicitly defining the paperformat in our module, we ensure it's always available regardless of the base module's configuration.
