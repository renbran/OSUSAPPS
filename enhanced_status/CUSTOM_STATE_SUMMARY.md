# Enhanced Status Module - Custom State Feature Summary

## ✅ Successfully Added Back the Custom State Feature

### 🔧 Model Changes (`sale_order_simple.py`)

**Added custom_state field:**
```python
custom_state = fields.Selection([
    ('draft', 'Draft'),
    ('confirmed', 'Confirmed'), 
    ('completed', 'Completed'),
], string='Custom State', default='draft', 
   help="Custom workflow state for enhanced order management")
```

**Enhanced compute methods:**
- `_compute_is_locked()` now considers both `custom_state == 'completed'` and `state == 'done'`

**New workflow methods:**
- `action_confirm_order()` - Moves from draft to confirmed
- `action_complete_order()` - Moves to completed state
- `action_unlock_order()` - Admin can unlock completed orders
- `action_reset_to_draft()` - Admin can reset orders to draft
- `get_custom_state_display()` - Helper method for display names

### 🎨 View Enhancements (`sale_order_simple_view.xml`)

**Form View Features:**
- Custom state displayed as clickable statusbar with visual progression
- Workflow buttons that appear/hide based on current state:
  - "Confirm Order" (visible in draft state)
  - "Mark Complete" (visible in draft/confirmed states)
  - "🔓 Unlock" (visible when locked, admin only)
  - "↶ Reset to Draft" (admin only, with confirmation)

**Tree View Features:**
- Custom state column with color decorations:
  - 🟢 Green for completed orders
  - 🔵 Blue for confirmed orders
  - ⚪ Muted for draft orders

### 🔐 Security & Permissions

### 🚀 Benefits

2. **Enhanced Control**: Admins can override workflow when needed
3. **Better Filtering**: Easy to find orders by custom state
4. **User-Friendly**: Intuitive buttons and confirmations
5. **Flexible**: Works alongside standard Odoo sale workflow

### 📊 Usage Examples

1. **Draft → Confirmed**: User clicks "Confirm Order" button
2. **Confirmed → Completed**: User clicks "Mark Complete" button  
3. **Completed → Unlocked**: Admin clicks "🔓 Unlock" (with confirmation)
