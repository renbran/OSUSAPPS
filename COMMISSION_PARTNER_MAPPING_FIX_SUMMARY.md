# Commission Partner Statement Report Enhancement

## Issue Resolution Summary

### **Problem Identified**
Users reported that commission lines were showing "different names instead of similar partner" in the Commission Partner Statement Report. After investigation, the root cause was identified:

**The commission partner statement report template was missing the Commission Partner column**, making it impossible for users to identify which partner each commission line belonged to.

### **Root Cause Analysis**
1. **Data Structure**: The wizard correctly extracts `partner_name` from commission lines
2. **Template Issue**: The PDF template only showed 7 columns without the partner name
3. **Excel Report**: The Excel export also lacked the commission partner column
4. **User Confusion**: When multiple partners have commissions, users couldn't distinguish which commission belonged to which partner

### **Solution Implemented**

#### 1. **PDF Template Updates** (`commission_partner_statement_template.xml`)
- **Added Commission Partner column** as the first column in the table
- **Updated table headers** to include "Commission Partner" 
- **Updated data rows** to display `line.get('partner_name', 'Unknown Partner')`
- **Fixed column spans** in totals footer (changed from colspan="4" to colspan="5")
- **Updated no-data message** colspan from 7 to 8 columns

#### 2. **Excel Report Updates** (`commission_partner_statement_wizard.py`)
- **Added Commission Partner column** as the first column
- **Updated headers array** to include "Commission Partner"
- **Updated column widths** configuration for 8-column structure
- **Updated data writing** to include `data['partner_name']` in column 0
- **Shifted all other columns** by one position to accommodate the new column
- **Updated totals row positioning** for the new 8-column layout
- **Updated title merge range** from 6 to 7 columns

### **New Report Structure**

| Column | Header | Data Source | Format |
|--------|--------|-------------|---------|
| 0 | Commission Partner | `line.partner_id.name` | Text, Bold |
| 1 | Booking Date | `sale_order.date_order` | Date |
| 2 | Client Order Ref | `sale_order.client_order_ref` | Text |
| 3 | Reference | `sale_order.name` | Text |
| 4 | Sale Value | `sale_order.amount_total` | Currency |
| 5 | Commission Rate | `line.rate` | Percentage |
| 6 | Total Amount | `line.commission_amount` | Currency |
| 7 | Payment Status | `line.state` | Badge |

### **Benefits of the Enhancement**
1. **Clear Partner Identification**: Users can now see which partner each commission belongs to
2. **Multi-Partner Reports**: When filtering by multiple partners, each row clearly shows the partner
3. **Consistent Layout**: Both PDF and Excel reports now have matching column structures
4. **Better User Experience**: Eliminates confusion about commission ownership
5. **Audit Trail**: Provides clear visibility of all commission assignments

### **Testing Recommendations**
1. **Single Partner Report**: Test with one partner selected
2. **Multi-Partner Report**: Test with multiple partners selected
3. **All Partners Report**: Test with no partner filter (show all)
4. **Excel Export**: Verify the Excel file has correct column alignment
5. **Empty Data**: Test with date ranges that have no commission data
6. **PDF Generation**: Ensure PDF renders correctly with new column

### **Files Modified**
- `commission_ax/reports/commission_partner_statement_template.xml`
- `commission_ax/wizards/commission_partner_statement_wizard.py`

### **Backward Compatibility**
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing data structure
- ✅ All existing commission lines will display correctly  
- ✅ Existing filters and functionality preserved
- ✅ Data extraction logic unchanged

The commission partner statement report now provides complete visibility into commission assignments, resolving the user's concern about partner name mapping.
