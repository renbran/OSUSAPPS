# Commission Partner Statement Report - Fix Summary

## 🚨 **RPC_ERROR Resolution**

**ERROR FIXED**: `KeyError: 'project_name'` in Excel report generation

## 📋 **Root Cause Analysis**

The commission partner statement report was updated to use `client_order_ref` from sales orders instead of project and unit information, but the Excel report generation method was not updated to match this new data structure, causing a KeyError when trying to access the removed `project_name` field.

## ✅ **Changes Made**

### 1. **Excel Report Structure Updated**
- **Headers**: Changed from 8 columns to 7 columns
- **Old Structure**: `Booking Date | Project | Unit | Reference | Sale Value | Commission Rate | Total Amount | Commission Payment Status`
- **New Structure**: `Booking Date | Client Order Ref | Reference | Sale Value | Commission Rate | Total Amount | Commission Payment Status`

### 2. **Data Mapping Corrections**
- ✅ `data['project_name']` → `data['client_order_ref']`
- ✅ Removed `data['unit']` references
- ✅ Updated column positions for all data fields
- ✅ Fixed totals row column positions

### 3. **Layout Adjustments**
- ✅ Updated title merge_range from 8 columns (0,7) to 7 columns (0,6)
- ✅ Adjusted column widths for better display
- ✅ Updated data writing positions to match new structure

### 4. **Data Extraction Enhancement**
- ✅ Primary source: `sale_order.client_order_ref`
- ✅ Fallback source: `purchase_order.partner_ref`
- ✅ Final fallback: `'No Reference'`
- ✅ Enhanced error handling with try-catch blocks
- ✅ Debug logging for troubleshooting

## 🔍 **Validation Results**

- ✅ **Python Syntax**: All files compile without errors
- ✅ **XML Templates**: All XML files have valid syntax
- ✅ **Data Structure**: Consistent between PDF and Excel reports
- ✅ **Field Mapping**: All old field references removed/updated

## 🚀 **Installation Status**

## 📝 **Testing Recommendations**

2. Test Excel report generation and download
