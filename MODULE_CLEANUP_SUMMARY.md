# Module Cache Cleanup Implementation Summary

## Overview

Implemented a comprehensive module cleanup solution for the OSUSAPPS Odoo 17 project to remove Python cache files, compiled bytecode, and temporary files. This solution improves module stability, prevents cache-related issues, and optimizes disk space usage.

## Implemented Files

1. `cleanup_modules.sh` - Bash script for Unix/Linux environments
2. `cleanup_modules.bat` - Batch script for Windows environments
3. `MODULE_CLEANUP_DOCUMENTATION.md` - Detailed documentation of the cleanup process

## Key Features

- **Safe Deletion**: Multiple safety checks prevent accidental deletion of important files
- **Backup Creation**: Automatically creates a backup archive before deletion
- **Dry Run Mode**: Preview what would be deleted without making changes
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed logs of all actions taken
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on both Windows and Unix/Linux environments
- **User Confirmation**: Requires user confirmation before proceeding with deletion

## Files Targeted for Cleanup

- Python cache directories (`__pycache__`)
- Python compiled bytecode files (`.pyc`)
- Temporary/backup files (`.bak`, `.backup`, `.tmp`, `.swp`, `~`)

## Implementation Details

The cleanup scripts perform the following operations:

1. Parse command-line arguments for options
2. Create a backup of all module directories (if enabled)
3. Find and remove Python cache directories
4. Find and remove Python compiled bytecode files
5. Find and remove temporary/backup files
6. Generate a detailed log file with all actions taken

## Usage

### Unix/Linux

```bash
./cleanup_modules.sh [--dry-run] [--no-backup] [--help]
```

### Windows

```cmd
cleanup_modules.bat [--dry-run] [--no-backup] [--help]
```

## Best Practices

- Run the script in dry-run mode first to verify what will be deleted
- Keep backups for a reasonable period before removing them
- Run the script before module updates or when encountering cache-related issues
- Schedule regular cleanups as part of maintenance routines

## Integration with CI/CD

The cleanup scripts can be integrated into CI/CD pipelines to ensure clean builds and deployments.
