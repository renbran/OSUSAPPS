# Commission Modules Deprecated Syntax Fix Summary

## Overview
Fixed deprecated syntax in both `commission_ax` and `commission_statement` modules to ensure Odoo 17 compatibility and resolved the installation error related to missing wizard models.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Missing Wizard Models
**Problem**: `commission.cancel.wizard` and `commission.draft.wizard` models were referenced in views but didn't exist.

**Solution**: Created `commission_cancel_wizard.py` with both wizard models:
- `commission.cancel.wizard`: Handles commission cancellation with user confirmation
- `commission.draft.wizard`: Handles setting commission back to draft with user confirmation

**Files Modified/Created**:
- `commission_ax/wizards/commission_cancel_wizard.py` (NEW)
- `commission_ax/wizards/__init__.py` (Updated to import new wizard)

### 2. Deprecated `attrs` Syntax
**Problem**: Using deprecated `attrs` attribute in XML views.

**Solution**: Replaced all `attrs` usage with modern `invisible`, `readonly`, etc. attributes.

**Files Modified**:
- `commission_ax/views/purchase_order.xml`
- `commission_ax/views/sale_order.xml`
- `commission_ax/views/commission_statement_wizard_views.xml`
- `commission_statement/views/commission_statement_views.xml`

### 3. Deprecated `modifiers` Syntax
**Problem**: Using deprecated `modifiers` attribute in XML views.

**Solution**: Replaced all `modifiers` usage with modern syntax.

**Files Modified**:
- `commission_ax/views/commission_wizard_views.xml`

## Changes Summary

### commission_ax Module

#### Views Fixed:
1. **purchase_order.xml**:
   - `attrs="{'invisible': [('origin_so_id', '=', False)]}"` â†’ `invisible="origin_so_id == False"`

2. **sale_order.xml** (21 instances):
   - Commission statement button visibility
   - Commission blocked reason alert
   - Commission action buttons
   - Commission percentage fields
   - Commission rate fields
   - Purchase orders tab visibility
   - Force post button visibility

3. **commission_wizard_views.xml** (6 instances):
   - Report generation groups and buttons
   - Report data field visibility

4. **commission_statement_wizard_views.xml**:
   - Commission report button visibility

#### New Wizards:
1. **commission_cancel_wizard.py**:
   - Provides user confirmation before cancelling commissions
   - Shows impact message with affected purchase orders
   - Integrates with existing `action_reset_commissions` method

### commission_statement Module

#### Views Fixed:
1. **commission_statement_views.xml**:
   - Commission report button visibility

## Conversion Examples

### Old Syntax (Deprecated):
```xml
<button attrs="{'invisible': [('field_name', '=', False)]}"/>
<field modifiers="{'readonly': [('other_field', '=', True)]}"/>
```

### New Syntax (Modern):
```xml
<button invisible="field_name == False"/>
<field readonly="other_field == True"/>
```

## Error Resolution

The original installation error was caused by:
```
Model not found: commission.cancel.wizard
```

This has been resolved by creating the missing wizard models and ensuring proper imports.

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Install/Upgrade Test**: Install or upgrade both modules to verify no syntax errors
2. **Functionality Test**: Test commission processing workflow
3. **Wizard Test**: Test commission cancellation and draft wizards
4. **Button Visibility**: Verify all buttons appear/hide correctly based on conditions

## Benefits

1. **Odoo 17 Compatibility**: Modules now use modern syntax compatible with Odoo 17
2. **Future-Proof**: Eliminated deprecated syntax warnings
3. **Better UX**: Added proper user confirmation dialogs for destructive operations
4. **Clean Installation**: Resolved model not found errors during installation
