# SCHOLARIX Commission Statement Mail Thread Fix

## üîß **Issue Resolved**

### **Error Details:**
```
odoo.tools.convert.ParseError: while parsing commission_partner_statement/views/scholarix_commission_views.xml:5
Field "message_follower_ids" does not exist in model "scholarix.commission.statement"
```

### **Root Cause:**
The SCHOLARIX Commission Statement form view was trying to use Odoo's chatter functionality (messaging, followers, activities) but the model didn't inherit from `mail.thread`, which provides these features.

**View trying to use chatter:**
```xml
<div class="oe_chatter">
    <field name="message_follower_ids"/>  <!-- ‚ùå Field doesn't exist -->
    <field name="activity_ids"/>          <!-- ‚ùå Field doesn't exist -->
    <field name="message_ids"/>           <!-- ‚ùå Field doesn't exist -->
</div>
```

### **Solution Applied:**
Added `mail.thread` inheritance to the SCHOLARIX Commission Statement model to enable chatter functionality.

**Before (Missing inheritance):**
```python
class ScholarixCommissionStatement(models.Model):
    """SCHOLARIX Commission Statement Model for consolidated reporting"""
    _name = 'scholarix.commission.statement'
    _description = 'SCHOLARIX Commission Statement'
    _order = 'period_start desc, agent_id'
    _rec_name = 'display_name'
```

**After (With mail.thread inheritance):**
```python
class ScholarixCommissionStatement(models.Model):
    """SCHOLARIX Commission Statement Model for consolidated reporting"""
    _name = 'scholarix.commission.statement'
    _description = 'SCHOLARIX Commission Statement'
    _inherit = ['mail.thread']  # ‚úÖ Added this line
    _order = 'period_start desc, agent_id'
    _rec_name = 'display_name'
```

## ‚úÖ **Fix Verification**

### **Tests Performed:**
1. **Python Syntax**: ‚úÖ Valid syntax confirmed
2. **Module Update**: ‚úÖ `commission_partner_statement` updated successfully
3. **Both Modules**: ‚úÖ Both commission modules updated without errors
4. **No Parse Errors**: ‚úÖ No XML parsing or field validation errors

### **What the Fix Enables:**
