# üöÄ Commission AX Module - Production Deployment Guide

## DEPLOYMENT STATUS: ‚úÖ READY FOR PRODUCTION

The commission_ax module has been thoroughly tested and validated for production deployment. All code quality issues have been resolved and the module is structurally complete.

## üìã PRE-DEPLOYMENT CHECKLIST

### Environment Requirements
- [ ] Odoo 17.0 installed and running
- [ ] PostgreSQL database accessible
