# üîç CODE REVIEW REPORT: Commission Modules Compatibility

## ‚ùå CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED

### 1. **FATAL MODEL NAME CONFLICT** ‚ö†Ô∏è RESOLVED
- **Issue**: Both `commission_ax` and `commission_statement` defined `commission.statement.wizard`
- **Fix Applied**: Renamed `commission_ax` wizard to `commission.partner.statement.wizard`
- **Impact**: Eliminates model registry conflicts

### 2. **SECURITY GROUP DEPENDENCIES** ‚úÖ RESOLVED
- **Issue**: `commission_ax` referenced undefined security groups
- **Fix Applied**: Updated to reference `commission_statement.group_commission_user`
- **Impact**: Proper dependency chain established

### 3. **XML ID CONFLICTS** ‚úÖ PARTIALLY RESOLVED
- **Issue**: Duplicate XML IDs between modules
- **Fix Applied**: Renamed views and actions in `commission_ax`
- **Remaining**: Need to complete view XML updates

### 4. **MANIFEST DEPENDENCIES** ‚úÖ RESOLVED
- **Issue**: Missing proper dependency declaration
- **Fix Applied**: Added `commission_statement` as dependency in `commission_ax`
- **Impact**: Proper installation order enforced
