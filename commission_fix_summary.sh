echo "🔧 Commission AX Module Fixes Applied"
echo "===================================="

echo ""
echo "✅ Fix 1: Removed non-existent commission_assignment_mixin import"
echo "   - Removed import from commission_ax/models/__init__.py"
echo "   - This was causing circular import error"

echo ""
echo "✅ Fix 2: Corrected field name in _compute_commission_stats"
echo "   - Changed 'commission_count' to 'commission_lines_count'"
echo "   - This was causing AttributeError on sale.order model"

echo ""
echo "📋 Verification:"
echo "   - Checking if commission_assignment_mixin import is removed..."
if grep -q "commission_assignment_mixin" commission_ax/models/__init__.py; then
    echo "   ❌ commission_assignment_mixin import still present"
else
    echo "   ✅ commission_assignment_mixin import removed"
fi

echo ""
echo "   - Checking if commission_count field reference is fixed..."
if grep -q "order.commission_count" commission_ax/models/sale_order.py; then
    echo "   ❌ commission_count reference still present"
else
    echo "   ✅ commission_count reference fixed"

echo "📁 Current commission_ax models structure:"
ls -la commission_ax/models/

echo "🚀 Next Steps:"
echo "   1. Restart Odoo: docker-compose restart odoo"
echo "   2. Check logs: docker-compose logs odoo | grep commission"
echo "   3. Verify module loads without errors"

echo ""
echo "🎯 These fixes should resolve:"
echo "   - SyntaxError: invalid decimal literal (already fixed)"
echo "   - Circular import error for commission_assignment_mixin"
echo "   - AttributeError: 'sale.order' object has no attribute 'commission_count'"
