# Commission_AX Module Cleanup Report

## Summary
Successfully cleaned up duplicate and unnecessary report templates from the commission_ax module.

## Files Removed
1. **commission_report_clean.xml** - Empty file with no content
2. **commission_report_new.xml** - Empty file with no content  
3. **commission_calculation_report.xml** - Placeholder file with no actual report definition

## Files Retained
All functional report templates were preserved:

### 1. commission_report.xml
- **Report**: Professional Commission Report
- **Model**: sale.order
- **Template**: commission_payout_report_template_professional
- **Purpose**: Detailed commission breakdown for sale orders with professional formatting

### 2. commission_report_template.xml
- **Report**: Team Commission Report  
- **Model**: sale.order
- **Template**: commission_report_template_team
- **Purpose**: Team-focused commission reporting structure

### 3. commission_statement_report.xml
- **Report**: Commission Statement
- **Model**: commission.partner.statement.wizard
- **Template**: commission_statement_report_template
- **Purpose**: Commission statement generation through wizard interface
- **Note**: Some functionality overlaps with commission_partner_statement module

### 4. per_order_commission_report.xml
- **Report**: Per Order Commission Report
- **Model**: commission.report.wizard  
- **Template**: per_order_commission_report_template
- **Purpose**: Individual order commission analysis

## Changes Made
1. Removed 3 empty/placeholder files
2. Updated `__manifest__.py` to remove references to deleted files
3. Verified all remaining reports are functional and serve distinct purposes

## Recommendations
- **commission_statement_report.xml** has some overlap with the commission_partner_statement module
- Consider consolidating commission statement functionality in the future
- The commission_partner_statement module provides more advanced features

## Verification
- ✅ Module update successful
- ✅ All 4 remaining reports still exist in database
- ✅ No functional reports were lost
- ⚠️ System-wide PDF cache issue persists (unrelated to this cleanup)

## Next Steps
The cleanup is complete. The commission_ax module now has a cleaner structure with only functional report templates.
