## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Commission Statement Wizard Updates
**File**: `commission_ax/wizards/commission_statement_wizard.py`

#### Rate Handling Enhancement:
```python
# Ensure rate is always in percentage format (5.0 for 5%)
display_rate = rate if comm_type != 'fixed' else 0.0
```

#### Excel Rate Formatting:
```python
# Rate is stored as percentage (5.0 = 5%), convert to decimal (0.05) for Excel percentage format
rate_decimal = line['rate'] / 100.0
worksheet.write(row, 4, rate_decimal, percentage_format)
```

#### New Commission Product Extraction:
```python
def _extract_commission_from_order_lines(self, order):
    """Extract commission data from sale order lines (commission products)"""
    # Scans for commission products in order lines
    # Maps products to partners based on product names
    # Returns commission data in unified format
```

#### Smart Partner Mapping:
```python
def _extract_partner_from_commission_line(self, line, order):
    """Extract partner from commission line based on role"""
    # Maps commission product names to appropriate partners:
    # 'PRIMARY COMMISSION' → consultant_id
    # 'MANAGER COMMISSION' → manager_id  
    # 'BROKER COMMISSION' → broker_partner_id
```

### PDF Report Template Updates
**File**: `commission_ax/reports/commission_statement_report.xml`

#### Updated Data Source:
```xml
<!-- Changed from o.statement_line_ids to data['commission_lines'] -->
<t t-if="data and data.get('commission_lines')">
    <t t-foreach="data['commission_lines']" t-as="line">
```

#### Rate Display Format (Exactly as Requested):
```xml
<td class="text-right">
    <t t-if="line['commission_type'] == 'fixed'">
        Fixed
    </t>
    <t t-else="">
        <span t-esc="'{:.2f}%'.format(line['rate'])"/>
    </t>
</td>
```

#### Commission Amount with Currency:
```xml
<td class="text-right">
    <span t-esc="'{:,.2f}'.format(line['amount'])"/> <span t-esc="currency_symbol"/>
</td>
```

#### New Table Structure:
- **Commission Partner**: Partner name receiving commission
- **Order Reference**: Sale order number
- **Customer Reference**: Customer name
- **Commission Type**: Type of commission (Fixed/Percentage)
- **Rate**: Percentage rate or "Fixed"
- **Amount**: Commission amount with currency
